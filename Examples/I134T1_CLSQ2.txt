# Below, input half-lives (in S, M, H, D, or Y with no space) for each component (NC), data for 1 component per line.

# Now input measured time and count data below.  As long as each time is on its own line and values are separated by at least one space, tab, or comma, spacing does not matter.
# The first 3 columns are decay time from EOB in D, H, and M. The fourth column is counts and the fifth column is measurement time for each sample in minutes.
