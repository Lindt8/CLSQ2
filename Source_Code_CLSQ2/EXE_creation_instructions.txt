See the CLSQ2 Documentation for more details regarding the .exe creation.

Simply put, if you have installed all of the libraries needed to run the code and py2exe, 
creating the .exe should be as simple as navigating to the folder containing both
setup.py and CLSQ2.py in the command window and typing: 

python setup.py

This should automatically run py2exe on the CLSQ2 code.  A "dist" folder should be created.
It will contain the .exe and all of the files that MUST be kept together for the executable to work.
